# TMImachine
TMImachine was built at The Stupid Shit No One Needs & Terrible Ideas Hackathon 2015 at Noisebridge, San Francisco.  

With this code, a CloudBit and a pressure sensor from littleBits you are 
able to build your own TMI machine. Place the TMI machine with the presure sensor 
on the toilet seat. This will enable the machine to send a tweet about when and 
how long the visit at the loo was. See examle at https://twitter.com/tmimachine
